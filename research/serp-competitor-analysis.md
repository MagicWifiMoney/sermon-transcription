# Sermon Transcription SERP & Competitor Analysis

**Report Date:** February 13, 2026  
**Analysis Type:** Complete SERP competitor research + domain availability

---

## Executive Summary

The sermon transcription market is **moderately competitive but highly fragmented**, split between:
- **AI-first pure players** (TurboScribe, PrismaScribe, ScreenApp) offering low-cost automated transcription
- **Human transcription services** (Intentional Reach, GMR Transcription) positioning as premium/accurate
- **Content repurposing platforms** (Sermon Shots, Pulpit AI) that bundle transcription into larger suites
- **Church software add-ons** (Proclaim/Logos, SermonAudio) where transcription is a feature, not the product

**Key finding:** No single player dominates. Most rank for only 1-2 of our target keywords, suggesting **opportunity for a focused, SEO-optimized pure transcription service**.

**Available premium domains:** `transcribesermons.com`, `sermontotext.com`, `sermontoblog.com`, `sermonwords.com`

---

### 4. "sermon to text" (Volume: Low | Intent: Informational)

**Results:** This keyword returned mostly **sermon archives and text repositories** (newchurch.org, executableoutlines.com, sermonindex.net), NOT transcription services.

### Option C: Hybrid — `transcribesermons.com` + `sermontoblog.com`
**Strategy:**
- `transcribesermons.com` = main product
- `sermontoblog.com` = content repurposing landing page (301 to main site or separate micro-site)

**Use case:** If we want to own both "transcription" and "content repurposing" positioning

---

## Conclusion

**Market Opportunity:** ✅ **HIGH**
- Fragmented competition (no dominant player)
- Most competitors are generalists with sermon landing pages
- Human services are expensive, AI tools lack church-specific features
- SEO gap: Most have minimal content, we can build moat

**Domain Strategy:** ✅ **`transcribesermons.com`**
- Available, affordable, strong SEO potential
- Backup: `sermontoblog.com` (unique positioning)

**Go-to-Market:**
- Launch with free tier (acquire users fast)
- Content-first SEO (rank for low-competition keywords first)
- Differentiate on sermon-specific AI + content repurposing
- Undercut suites ($19/mo vs. $40-100/mo)

**Timeline to $10k MRR:** 12-18 months (aggressive content + paid ads)

**Biggest Risks:**
1. Incumbent platforms (SermonAudio, Proclaim) add better transcription
2. General AI tools (HappyScribe, Rev) improve sermon accuracy
3. Sermon Shots or Pulpit AI drop pricing

**Mitigation:**
- Build moat FAST (content, integrations, theological AI)
- Focus on underserved segment (small churches)
- Expand to content repurposing (harder to commoditize)

**Next Steps:**
1. Register `transcribesermons.com` (TODAY)
2. Build MVP (transcription API + simple UI)
3. Launch free tier (1 sermon/month)
4. Write 4 blog posts (target "sermon to text", "sermon to blog")
5. Outreach: 5 backlinks from church blogs
6. Revisit in 90 days with traction data
