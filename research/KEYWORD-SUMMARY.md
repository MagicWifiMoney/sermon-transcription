## The Big Opportunity (Category Creation)

**The Gap:** Churches don't search for "sermon transcription" - they search for outcomes:
- ❌ "sermon blog post generator" - **no data** (market doesn't know it exists)
- ❌ "turn sermon into blog post" - **no data**
- ❌ "repurpose sermon content" - **no data**
- ✅ "church website content" - only 10 searches, comp 100

**Our Play:**
1. Educate that sermon audio → transcription → blog content
2. Own the educational content via SEO
3. Natural funnel into our product

**Analogy:** Like Zapier creating the "workflow automation" category before people knew they needed it.

## Questions to Answer

## Final Recommendation

**Go all-in on content SEO.**

This market has:
- ✅ Proven buyer intent (high CPCs)
- ✅ Minimal competition (comp index <30)
- ✅ Adjacent opportunities (archives, notes, search)
- ✅ Seasonal spikes (Easter = 11x traffic)
- ✅ Viral potential (free tools, pastor sharing)

**The catch:** It's a 3-6 month play, not instant. But once the content ranks, it compounds. Every blog post is a long-term asset.

**Start with:** 4 Tier 1 blog posts + 3 core landing pages + Easter promo prep.

**Expected outcome in 90 days:** Top 10 for 2-3 core keywords, 500+ organic visitors, 50+ free trials, 5+ paid customers from SEO.

**ROI:** If 5 customers @ $50/mo = $250 MRR from $4,300 investment = breakeven in 17 months. But that's Month 3—by Month 6, if content is ranking well, we could have 20+ organic customers = $1,000 MRR = 4-month payback.

**Verdict:** High-confidence recommendation to execute this strategy.
