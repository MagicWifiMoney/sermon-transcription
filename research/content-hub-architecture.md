Churches use transcription services to create searchable sermon archives, improve accessibility for deaf and hard of hearing members, and repurpose sermons into blog posts, social media content, and study materials.

**List Snippets:**
- Use ordered lists for process/steps
- Use unordered lists for tips/ideas
- Keep list items concise (under 50 words each)

**Table Snippets:**
- Use HTML tables for comparisons
- Include headers and clear data
- Example: Pricing comparison tables, feature comparisons
