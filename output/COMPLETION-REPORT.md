## 💡 Content Strategy Notes

**Easter Post is Time-Sensitive:**
The Easter post targets a keyword that spikes 11x in April (from 260/mo to 2,900/mo). Publishing NOW (mid-February) gives Google 6-8 weeks to index and rank before the April traffic spike. This is the highest-impact post for immediate results.

**Internal Linking Network:**
All 5 posts link to each other strategically, creating a "content hub" around sermon transcription. This helps with SEO (topical authority) and keeps readers engaged on the site.

**Conversion Focus:**
Every post includes multiple CTAs to `/transcribe` (free trial) and `/pricing`. The posts are designed to educate while guiding readers toward trying the service.

**Competitive Positioning:**
Post 5 compares sermon-transcription.com against competitors (Rev, Otter, Descript) and positions it as the winner for churches based on:
- Best pricing ($0.27-0.90 vs $9-67)
- Church-specific features (Bible verse recognition, outline generation)
- Accuracy optimized for religious terminology
