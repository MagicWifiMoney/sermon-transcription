Hi [First Name],

Following up on my note from earlier this week.

I wanted to share something specific: Community Baptist Church in Nashville had a similar setup to yours — they were paying $1.50/min for transcription. Their admin told us:

"Our church admin used to spend 3 hours on transcription every Sunday. Now it takes 5 minutes. The accuracy is remarkable."

At $0.27 per sermon, they went from spending ~$800/year on transcription to about $14/year. They now publish:
- Full transcripts on their website (→ Google indexes sermon content)
- Captions on every YouTube sermon video (→ more views, better accessibility)
- Weekly sermon blog posts (→ congregation engagement)

For [Church Name], that's a real option — and it takes about 5 minutes to set up.
