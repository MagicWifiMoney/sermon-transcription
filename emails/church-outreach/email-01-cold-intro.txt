Hi [First Name],

I came across [Church Name] while researching churches that are actively posting sermon content online. Your congregation is doing great work making sermons accessible.

Quick question: how are you currently handling transcription for your messages?

Most churches I talk to are either:
- Paying a service like Rev.com ($1.50/min = ~$67 per sermon) 😬
- Doing it manually (3+ hours of volunteer time per week)
- Not transcribing at all (and missing SEO + accessibility benefits)

We built Sermon Transcription specifically for churches. It uses AI to transcribe your sermons for $0.27 each — accurate, fast, and a fraction of what you're paying now.

Here's what you get per sermon:
✓ Full text transcript (download as .txt, .srt, .docx)
✓ Captions-ready SRT file for YouTube/Vimeo
✓ Searchable archive for your congregation
✓ 500 free words to try it today

No contract, no monthly fee to start. Pay per sermon.

Would it be worth a 5-minute conversation to see if this makes sense for [Church Name]?

If you want to try it right now: sermon-transcription.com (first 500 words free)

Grace and peace,

P.S. — For context, we're 250x cheaper than Rev.com. A typical 40-minute sermon costs $0.27 with us vs. $60 with Rev. The math is pretty simple.
