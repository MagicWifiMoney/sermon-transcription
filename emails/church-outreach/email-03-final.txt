Hi [First Name],

I don't want to clutter your inbox, so this is my last note.

If sermon transcription isn't on your radar right now, totally understood — no hard feelings.

But if you ever run into this problem:
- Manual transcription eating up volunteer hours every week
- Rev.com bills adding up ($60+ per sermon)
- Sermons that aren't accessible to your hearing-impaired congregation
- Sermon content that's invisible to search engines

...we're at sermon-transcription.com, and you can try the first 500 words free.

We work with 500+ churches. Setup takes 5 minutes. No contract, no monthly fee.

If the timing isn't right, I'll leave you alone. 🙏

[Your Name]

P.S. — ADA accessibility compliance is becoming more important for faith organizations. Full transcripts = compliance + outreach to hearing-impaired members. Just something to keep in mind.
